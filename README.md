# Digital twins for coin cell battery
This repository will serve as a deliverable 3.1 (Data schema for a digital twin applicable in battery research) for PREMISE project. 

## Authors

## Goals
This repository will illustrate how one can digitally represent a coin cell battery by creating a digital twin. We have developed a pipeline to represent a coin cell battery as a digital twin in a digital notebook [OpenBis](https://openbis.ch/).


## Achievements
Describe here how this repository achieves the above goal.

## External links
List here any relevant tools used in preparing this deliverable that are not maintained by PREMISE.
