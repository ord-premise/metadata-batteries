# D3.1 - Data schema for a digital twin applicable in battery research
Metadata schemas to digitally represent coin cell batteries

## Goals
This repository introduces a set of metadata schemas designed for documenting the provenance of coin cell batteries. The schemas are provided in Excel format, facilitating ease of use without requiring specialized technical knowledge, thereby accommodating the general battery research community accustomed to Excel. 
The Excel schema, available as `coin_cell_battery_schemas.xlsx`, allows users to input metadata in a straightforward manner. 

Moreover, we include a Python script, `excel_to_json-ld_converter.py`, that can be used to convert the Excel-based metadata into JSON-LD files. The conversion process integrates semantic annotations using concepts from [BattINFO](https://big-map.github.io/BattINFO/index.html), enabling the creation of semantically annotated digital twins in JSON-LD format.


## Achievements
This repository contains all the files needed for creating a digital twin of a coin cell battery in JSON-LD format.
